# R1-V: Reinforcing Super Generalization Ability in Vision Language Models with Less Than $3



1. We firstly reveal that **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)** outperforms chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) in both **effectiveness and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness** for vision language models.

2. In our experiment, we **incentivize** VLMs to learn **generalizable** visual counting abilities, rather than overfitting to the training set.

3. The 2B model outperforms the 72B model in OOD tests within just **100** training steps.

4. The training was conducted on 8 A100 GPUs for **30 minutes, costing $2.62**.

5. Codes, models, datasets, more details and **all open-source** resources will be shared (within CNY holidays).

Updates:

- 2025-02-03: We upload the training codebase.
- 2025-02-03: We curate and upload some verified Deepseek-R1 visual reasoning traces with some special tricks. Current training code does not rely on it, feel free to explore.
